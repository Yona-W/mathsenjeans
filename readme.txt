Explain rules, much detail + examples everywhere (if this isn't good, the presentation is impossible to understand) 
 
Early game: 
 
        - Prevent 1's and 2's from appearing (would give the opponent a point advantage early on) 
        - Try to build a "tower" (try to transition into midgame, ability to pressure the enemy. If I hoard the stones, they have less -> more capturable patterns 
        - Keep all stones as long as possible (stops the opponent from building a tower, preventing them from entering midgame and, here again, forcing them to create opportunities) 
 
Mid game: 
         
        - Towers seem to give an advantage (sweeping the whole board): ability to circle the board twice lets you score and try to win by points + starves the opponent of stones 
        - I can transform, for instance, a [1101] into a [2212] that I can entirely capture 
        - Get to endgame by mostly clearing the opponent's board. -> keep a tower as well as medium (~5 - 11) stacks to capture those patterns 
 
End game: 
 
        - Try to stall for time as much as possible 
        - Move all stones individually 
        - Start by opening the stacks at the end of the play area and never give the opponent a stone (they'd gain 5 turns). Once they have no more stones, you win (because they have < 24 stones)
